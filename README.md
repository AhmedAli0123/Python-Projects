# Python Projects in Google Colab

This repository contains nine Python projects that I created using Google Colab. These projects cover various fundamental and interactive applications, from simple games to web-based applications using Streamlit.

## List of Projects with Google Colab Links

### 1. Mad Libs Python Project
A fun word game where users provide random words to generate a humorous or unexpected story.

## How to Use
1. Click on the respective Google Colab link for the project you want to explore.
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
3. Run the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
4. Modify the code and experiment with different inputs to understand the functionality.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- Streamlit (for web apps)

## Future Improvements
I plan to enhance these projects by adding more features and improving the UI for Streamlit applications.

Feel free to explore and contribute to these projects!
